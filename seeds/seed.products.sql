Terracycle sends you a box to fill with the correct recyclables and lets you ship it back to them so that you know it gets to the right place.

        'You might think that a meal delivery service would have a huge carbon footprint, but the truth is that the carbon footprint of a meal delivery service is actually about a third of what it would be if the same meal was bought at a super market. The trouble is that some meal delivery services dont have any organic or sustainable options. Sun Basket started out exclusively selling organic meals, and continues to offer organic as an option. Most of the meals are easy to cook and can be ready in about 30 minutes. In a world where shipping and packages is becoming the norm, the main issue with it is packaging waste. Still, even if the packaging is disposed of incorrectly, the carbon footprint is still much lower than shopping at a super market.',
        'The downside to Sun Basket is all the little plastics they use. But they do try their best to use eco-friendly packaging as much as possible. The plastic bags can be recycled with a bag service. The plastic jars can be reused and recycled. The cardboard box can be recycled at most recycling centers. Sun Basket uses a few different types of insulation, some may be able to be recycled like cardboard, and some may have to be sent to a fabric recycling center.',
